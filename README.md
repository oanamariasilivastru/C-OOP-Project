Project Description:
Title: C++ Bookstore

This project is a C++ Bookstore application implemented using object-oriented programming principles, graphical user interface (GUI), dynamic components, dynamic buttons, and filtering functionalities.

The C++ Bookstore application allows users to browse, search, and manage a collection of books. It utilizes a GUI for user interaction, providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The interface dynamically generates components such as buttons, based on user actions and data changes.

Key Features:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project heavily relies on OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to represent books, users, and other entities within the system.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The application utilizes a GUI to enhance user experience, providing a visual representation of book data and interactive elements for user input.

Dynamic Components: The GUI dynamically generates components like book listings, user profiles, and search results based on user actions and changes in the underlying data.

Dynamic Buttons: Buttons within the interface are created dynamically, allowing for flexibility in adding functionalities and responding to user interactions.

Filtering: The application incorporates filtering mechanisms to allow users to refine their search results based on criteria such as genre, author, or publication date.

Lessons Learned:

OOP Design: Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to design and implement systems using object-oriented principles. I learned how to create classes, establish relationships between them, and encapsulate data and behaviors effectively.

GUI Development: Developing a GUI in C++ taught me how to design and implement user interfaces, including handling user input, updating visual elements dynamically, and maintaining a consistent user experience.

Dynamic Components and Buttons: Implementing dynamic components and buttons enhanced my skills in handling dynamic data and user interactions. I learned how to create, modify, and manage elements within the interface programmatically.

Filtering Mechanisms: Implementing filtering functionalities improved my understanding of data manipulation and user-driven interactions. I learned how to process user input, filter data based on specified criteria, and present refined results to the user.

Undo Functionality: Integrates undo functionality to enable users to revert their actions, such as removing a book from the cart, applying filters, etc. This feature adds flexibility and improves user control by providing a mechanism to correct mistakes or change decisions.
