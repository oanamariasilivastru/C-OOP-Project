<h1>Project Description:</h1>
<h1></h1>Title: C++ Bookstore</h1>

This project is a C++ Bookstore application implemented using object-oriented programming principles, graphical user interface (GUI), dynamic components, dynamic buttons, and filtering functionalities.

The C++ Bookstore application allows users to browse, search, and manage a collection of books. It utilizes a GUI for user interaction, providing an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The interface dynamically generates components such as buttons, based on user actions and data changes.

<h2>Key Features:</h2>

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project heavily relies on OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to represent books, users, and other entities within the system.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The application utilizes a GUI to enhance user experience, providing a visual representation of book data and interactive elements for user input.

Dynamic Components: The GUI dynamically generates components like book listings, user profiles, and search results based on user actions and changes in the underlying data.

Dynamic Buttons: Buttons within the interface are created dynamically, allowing for flexibility in adding functionalities and responding to user interactions.

Filtering: The application incorporates filtering mechanisms to allow users to refine their search results based on criteria such as genre, author, or publication date.

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

<h3>OOP Design:</h3> Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to design and implement systems using object-oriented principles. I learned how to create classes, establish relationships between them, and encapsulate data and behaviors effectively.

<h3>GUI Development:</h3>Developing a GUI in C++ taught me how to design and implement user interfaces, including handling user input, updating visual elements dynamically, and maintaining a consistent user experience.

<h3>Dynamic Components and Buttons:</h3> Implementing dynamic components and buttons enhanced my skills in handling dynamic data and user interactions. I learned how to create, modify, and manage elements within the interface programmatically.

<h3>Filtering Mechanisms:</h3> Implementing filtering functionalities improved my understanding of data manipulation and user-driven interactions. I learned how to process user input, filter data based on specified criteria, and present refined results to the user.

<h3>Undo Functionality:</h3> Integrates undo functionality to enable users to revert their actions, such as removing a book from the cart, applying filters, etc. This feature adds flexibility and improves user control by providing a mechanism to correct mistakes or change decisions.

This project extends the functionality of the C++ bookstore to include a shopping cart feature where users can add desired books for purchase. Additionally, users have the option to generate a random number of books to be added to the cart. When users press the "View Cart" button, they can see the number of books they have added to the cart, and icons representing the books are displayed.
